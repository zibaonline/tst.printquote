== Description ==
Cartpauj Register Captcha does one simple task, and does it well. It prevents SPAM signups through WordPress's default registration form. There are no settings to configure or get confused with. Just activate and watch those SPAM sign-ups fade away! Cartpauj Register Captcha blocks bots by using two different methods to deter bots:
* Method 1, it adds a CAPTCHA code which can only be read by humans.
* Method 2, it adds a field which is only visible to bots -- bots attempt to fill out all fields when they SPAM forms -- so if we detect input in the hidden field, we know it was a bot, and the signup is rejected.
